# Text PackedFiles

![It's textual, you know?](./images/image20.png)

RPFM can open and edit a wide variety of Text PackedFiles, such as `XML, HTML, LUA, TXT,...`. It has native **Undo/Redo support, Copy/Paste support,...** the normal things for a very basic text editor.

Also, exclusive for Warhammer 2 Lua files, there is an option to `Check Syntax`. This will pass the file through `Kailua` (if installed and in the `Path`) and return you a list of errors encountered. Keep in mind **this is experimental,** exclusive to Warhammer 2 Lua Files and it may fail.
