# 1.3.5

- Implemented ***initial support for compressed PackedFiles*** (only decompression for now).
- Updated RPFM's code to use Rust 2018 edition.
- Restructured a lot of code to be more consistent.
- Improved decryption logic (opening a 300mb PackFile has come down **from 25s to 9s**).
- Fixed a bug that caused PackedFiles to not open under certain circustances.
- Fixed a bug that caused the `Global Search` feature to load to memory useless data.
- Fixed a bug that caused the `Global Search` feature to not work when used with `Load All CA PackFiles`.
- Fixed a bug that caused very specific PackFiles to not open.
- Fixed missing references in Warhammer 1 tables.
- Fixed all instances of reference columns misplaced in tables, for all supported games.
- Fixed a bug in the "Apply Maths to Selection" feature that could cause operations with floats to not work properly.
- Fixed certain very rare bug that could theoretically cause RPFM to save incomplete PackFiles.
- Fixed a few hangs when trying to add files/folders to a MyMod.
- Fixed a ton of Clippy warnings (about 400).
- Fixed little bugs here and there. Now their legs work again.
