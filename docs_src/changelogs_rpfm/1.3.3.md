# 1.3.3

- Implemented a "Disable combos in tables" setting, so baldy can shut up.
- Fixed a bug that caused combos to "forget" their current value if that value wasn't originally in the combo.
- Fixed a hang when using the "MyMod/Install" feature.
- Fixed a bug that caused the MyMod menu options to be disabled when you just created a MyMod.
- Heavily optimized the "Delete Row" and "Smart Delete" features for DB Tables and Loc PackedFiles.
