# 1.0.1

- Implemented `Start Maximized` setting.
- Implemented `Extend Last Column on DB Tables` setting.
- Implemented a kidna `Typo-Checker` for references in tables (more on that later).
- Fixed a bug that caused PackFiles saved with RPFM to sometimes, for some random people (it couldn't be less consistent this damn bug) crash the game on start.
- Fixed a CTD when pressing `Del` while nothing is selected in the main TreeView.
- Fixed some instances where you could overwrite the currently open PackedFile by adding another with the same name.
- Changed the default `Add Row` shortcut in tables so it doesn't overrule the `Select All`.
- Now you can delete/rename PackedFiles while there is one open, just you can't do it to the one open.
- A ton of internal cleaning/reworking, very needed after all the reworks it has received in the last few months.
