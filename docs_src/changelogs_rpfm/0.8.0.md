# 0.8.0

- Implemented **full support for Total War: Attila**.
- Implemented **Schema Updater**.
- Implemented **```Allow Edition of CA PackFiles```** preference.
- Implemented **```Check Schema Updates on Start```** preference.
- Implemented **```Copy/Paste column```** action for DB Tables and Loc PackedFiles.
- Implemented **```Create Loc/DB/Text PackedFile```** feature.
- Implemented **```Mass-Import TSV Files```** feature.
- Import/Export system has been moved from CSV to TSV files.
- The entire ```Copy/Paste XXX``` has been revised, with plenty of bugs fixed.
- The ```<=``` button to add PackedFiles from another PackFile ***IS NOW PINK***. You can no longer complain you can't see it!.
- Rewritten a lot of... very low quality code. This means:
  - PackFiles **consume half the RAM** than before when opening and saving.
  - PackFiles **open +300% faster and save +225% faster** (tested in an SSD).
  - PackFiles open using ```Add from PackFile``` **no longer take brutal amounts of RAM**.
  - In case it isn't clear enough, you can now use ```Add from PackFile``` to add PackedFiles from ```data.pack``` without your computer hanging itself to death. 
  - DB Tables should now open faster.
- Updated a lot of outdated dependencies.
- Minimum Rust version required to build is now 1.26.
- Fixed a corruption bug when you delete a PackedFile.
- Fixed a bug that caused some tables created with ```Add from TSV``` feature from PFM to be unopenable.
- Fixed a bug that caused ```Paste XXX``` action to be partially broken in Loc PackedFiles.
- Fixed some text files not opening properly due to character encoding issues.
