# 0.8.2

- (0.8.2) Fixed update message not showing if somewhere in it there was an ampersan.
- (0.8.1) Fixed a bug that caused RPFM to not start if you had enabled "Check Schema Updates on Start" in prefs (which is the default) and tried to open a PackFile by double-clicking on it.
- Updated Warhammer 2 Schemas.
