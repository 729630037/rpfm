# 0.9.2

- Removed the ```PackFile succesfully saved``` message when saving a PackFile. You can already see if it saved by what it says in the titlebar, so it was redundant.
- Now, when you hover the mouse over a column of a table for a second, a tooltip will pop up saying to **what table/column that column references**.
- Paste in tables and locs has been renamed to ```Paste in Selection``` and moved to the ```Paste...``` submenu.
- Implemented ```Paste as New Rows``` for tables and locs. The shortcut is ```Ctrl+Shift+V```.
- Fixed a couple of bugs related to how things got copied from/to Excel, and with blank cells.
- Fixed a ***Mayor*** typo in the update checker.
