# 1.4.2

- Implemented a new `Generate PAK File` Special Feature for all games except Empire and Napoleon.
- Divided the `Remember Column State` setting into multiple individual settings.
- Added a new `Check for Missing Table Definition` setting to the Settings window.
- Now you can unsort a table by clicking his column header 3 times (sort asc, sort desc, unsort).
- Fixed multiple Special Stuff actions for Shogun 2, Napoleon and Empire doing nothing and showing no status tip.
- Fixed a CTD when trying to Search&Replace case insensitive data in a DB Table/Loc.
- Fixed a bug that caused the ***Settings/Shortcuts*** to get weird if you hit `Restore Default` then "Cancel`.
- Fixed a bug that caused the `This column is referenced in X table` to not popup when hovering the column header of a referenced column.
- Some internal changes as preparation for a future cleanup.
