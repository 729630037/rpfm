### Rules for contributing to RPFM.
You can contribute to RPFM development in multiple ways:
- **Docs**: There is a manual, but tutorials are always welcome.
- **Schemas**: If you want to update an schema, just send me the edited file and I'll add your changes (or edit it and do a pull request, whatever you want).
- **Code**: If you want to contribute with some code change, there are two rules: ***explain what your code does*** and ***no black magic code***. The reason for those rules is I'm using this project to learn Rust, so complex code without explanation doesn't help me learn anything.

If you don't have any idea why something is done, just ask. Even I forgot why some things are done when I don't write a comment about it.
